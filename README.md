# Torchlight MapVania Mod

A small Mod for Torchlight 1 that replaces the random dungeon map scrolls.
I recommend using the merchant pack mod or a mod with the cartographer vendor.

Features:

- only 1 map type per dungeon type for all level ranges (map level = your current hero level)
- maps with TL story boss fights (mostly 1 random level + 1 boss level)
- crypt and palace have multiple boss fights and no random maps
- map names are in german - you can change the name in the dungeon/randomxxxxx.dat files (<TRANSLATE>DISPLAYNAME:)

Installation:

Copy the MapVania folder into your Torchlight mod folder %appdata%\runic games\torchlight\mods

Have fun. :)
